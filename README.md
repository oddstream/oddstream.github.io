* [Solitaire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddstream.solitaire)

Most people know Klondike, and a few more know Spider or Freecell or Pyramid, but there's a lot more to solitaire than that.

(Klondike is not a very good game, because you have about a 33% chance of winning each game, and that mostly comes down to luck. Contrast that with Freecell (probably the most interesting version); over 99% of games are winnable, and each is won by 99% skill.)

This is a small well-chosen collection of solitaire variations, including: Agnes (the Morehead and Mott-Smith version) · Assembly · Australian · Baker's Dozen · Blockade · Canfield · Cruel · Forty and Eight · Forty Thieves · Freecell · Josephine · Klondike · Limited · Martha · Miss Mop ·Osmosis · Perseverance · Poker Squares · Poker Shuffle · Scorpion · Simple Simon · Single Rail · Spider · Spiderette · Thoughtful · Wasp · Whitehead · Yukon

WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER SOLITAIRES?

This solitaire is all about flow. Anything that distracts from your interaction with the flow of the game has been either been tried and removed or not included. "Weniger aber besser" (less but better) as they say in Germany.

Crucially, the default cards are simple and easy to scan; the games can be played by tapping the card you wish to move, and the software figures out where you want the card to go (mostly to the foundation if possible, and if not, the biggest tableau).

Also, the games are authentic, by taking the rules from reputable sources and implementing them exactly. For example, the tableau shuffling algorithm for Cruel and Perseverance has been chosen carefully, Blockade refills empty tableaux from the stock, Baker's Dozen shuffles kings to he bottom of each tableau.

* [Twitty Words (Early Access)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddstream.twitty)

Yet another "find words in a grid of letters" game, but this one has a Scrabble(tm) bias with tile scores and letter distributions that will be familiar to most people. Play against yourself, or the in-game robot, or against the clock.

* [PUCK·MAZE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddstream.puckmaze)

A modern take on Pac-Man(tm) designed specifically for a single-tap interface, with randomly generated levels and evil ghosts.

* [PIXIE·MAZE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddstream.PixieMaze)

A vaguely rogue-like take on PUCK·MAZE; explore a series of randomly generated levels, collecting useful power-ups and dodging evil ghosts of many colors.

* [Mycelium Loops](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddstream.mycelium)

As simple as a game can get, because there are no menus, scores, timers, rewards, or fancy graphics. And yet, it's strangely relaxing and has that "just one more go" vibe to it.

Just tap or spin the shapes to make them line up, then recycle the screen and do it again.
